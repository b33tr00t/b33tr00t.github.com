<h5>About the author and this blog</h5>
<p>I have left my fairly well paid city job to do something different with my life. That was over a year ago. I had a small list of things to do before you die such as traveling to Japan, bungee-jumping and having sex with 18 year old lesbien twins. I did all of them save the last one. I had lot of time on my hand and I don't know how but ended up on a hacker wargame site and started to do the missions. One thing led to another and I started to learn c++. A few weeks in it became clear that the thing I want to do is writing code. Since then I spent all my time learning.</p>
<p>This small corner of the interwebs is where I record my further adventures, some programming related matterial and random notes.</p>
<h5>Why house it on github?</h5>
<p>I am aware that any self-respecting geek should run their own webserver from the basement of their house but I don't have a basement. Besides it makes sence to keep it together with my projects and it is easy to update.</p>
