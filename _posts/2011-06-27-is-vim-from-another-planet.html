title: Is VIM from another planet? 
---
<html>
<p>Before the text editor fanatics load up the troll cannons let me make it clear that I don't want to turn this into a religious discussion. This is simply the summary of my first week using VIM the successor of the legendary VI editor.</p>
<p>My first encounter with vi was back 10 years ago when I first installed a linux distro. It might have been a Red Hat. It was a very short fling with vi. I fired it up and after 10 minutes of frustration of not being able to do anything not even to close it I finally gave up and turned my computer off.</p>
<p>Many years later me still being a linux user but not a kid anymore had a chat with a friend of mine and somehow vim came up. She went on and on how great it is. She is a copywriter, translator, blogger and a wannabe writer. So when it comes to handling text she is an authority. After my hangover wore off the following afternoon I have decided to take a second look at vim.</p>
<h5>The second first look.</h5>
<p>After watching a tutorial on youtube and making a note of how to get out of it in case things go pear shaped(:q!) I started it up from the command line. First impressions: it does not look nice and even the simplest things such as writing something requires me to look into the documentation.</p>
<p>Luckily I have found the vim tutor command in the man page. From there things started to make sense and slowly it became clear that there is lot more to it just need to take the time to discover it. The tutor is aimed at complete beginners like me and walks you through the basics. An hour later I was able to edit and navigate in text files and I could even save the document. Although it was a very slow process.</p>
<h5>One week later.</h5>
<p>Still there is a lot more I need to learn to unleash all the power within but I don't think I could do without vim anymore. It turned into from a pain in the neck to a very effective tool during the past week. The most important thing to take home from the built in tutor is not trying to force it and memorize the commands and motions. It will come to you naturally through practice. I made up a cheat sheet and added every new thing I learned. Actually I am writing this post in vim. In fact I wrote the script of this whole blog in vim.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>It is not a nice looking app with a fancy GUI and it does not try to be. If you only need a text editor to update your cv once in every 5 years then vi is probably not for you. On the other hand if you deal with text files a lot may that be for writing code or the next bestseller you are a fool if you at least don't consider it. It is a professional tool that requires you to invest time to learn it. It will punish you for taking it lightly and pressing random keys out of frustration but if you take the time to master the commands it will turn into an invaluable tool.</p>
