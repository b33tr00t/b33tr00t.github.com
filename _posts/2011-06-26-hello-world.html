title: Hello World!

<html>

<p>This title is lame. But it should suggest what follows, right? This is the first post here. As you probably know when you start learning something new you don't have much choice. You either write a lot of foo and bar or stick with hello world! Since I can't stand foo and bar for some reason, I am left with this.</p>
<p>Please bear with me though. Soon I'll get a grip on jekyll.</p>
